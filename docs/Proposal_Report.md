##  Background
### What is it about? 
The project is about using chicago crime data to model and understand crime patterns in Chicago. This involves:
1. Identifying trends over time (e.g., by type of crime, location, or season).
2. Using statistical or machine learning techniques to predict crime occurrences.
3. Understanding correlations between various factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, neighborhood features) and crime rates.
### Why does it matter? 
It helps local authorities allocate resources more effectively (e.g., police presence). Understanding crime patterns can aid in policymaking to reduce crime rates. It contributes to improving public safety by providing insights into when and where crimes are more likely to occur. Predictive models can be used in urban planning and community development to mitigate factors that may lead to higher crime rates.
### Research Questions:
1. What types of crimes are most frequent in specific neighborhoods of Chicago?
2. Are there time-based patterns (e.g., certain crimes happening more at night or during specific seasons)?
3. What socioeconomic or environmental factors contribute most significantly to crime?
4. Can spatial analysis identify accident hotspots, and how do traffic volume and speed limits relate to crash rates?
5. Can crime be accurately predicted using historical data and various machine learning algorithms?
